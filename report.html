    <h1>Project Report</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Our site uses the github repo as made by our teacher.</li>
      <li>Our site it published at: (link here)</li>
      <li>This is our report html page</li>
      <li>TODO mark where the site is adjusted for small and large screens</li>
      <li>Our page contains 5 different pages, all link back to each other in a reasonable manner through a navbar, and our homepage is named index.html.</li>
      <li>Each page contains a header.</li>
      <li>We have one navbar on each page.</li>
      <li>We have multiple images on pages like our home and personal page, and they all have alt tags that match the image accordingly.</li>
      <li>All pages validate through the Nu validator and WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluator.(TODO, THEY DON'T ACTUALLY)</li>
      <li>For our two font faces, we utilized Andale Mono for the bulk of our pages and monospace for our calendar headers.</li>
      <li>Our personal page contains a form with aligned content.(TODO, =not really aligned)</li>
      <li>what</li>
      <li>One Idea we have is to call the spotify api for the "listening to" on a user's profile. We also have plans to allow for the user to make their own account, and interact with other users on the site.</li>
